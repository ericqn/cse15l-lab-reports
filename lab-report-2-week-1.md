__Installing VS Code__

This step was not necessary for me as I had VS Code installed on my laptop before the course. Installing it was most likely a matter of going onto the page and following a set of instructions to get the download file.

__Remotely Connecting__

I used the ssh command to connect using my unique cse 15L account into one of UCSD's remote server. Since I was not able to log onto my own account during the lab hours, I had to use the TA login and password.

__Trying some Commands__
There were a couple of useful commands that I used:
_cd:_ allows you to enter directories through paths
_cat:_ writes out the lines in a text file
_mkdir:_ allows you to create a new directory with a certain name

__Moving Files with scp command__

I copied some code from the lab and put it into a file named WhereAmI.java, which allows the user to see the server, directory, and username of the current path. I used the scp command to then send the file to the ta's account on the remote server. Finally, I used the cp command in order to further move the file into my own personal directory.

__Setting an SSH Key__

Was not able to do this since I had to use a TA account. I tried to log into my account multiple times across the day after the lab, but was unable to do so. I reset multiple passwords and waited god knows how long for no results.

__Optimizing Remote Running__

This step built off the last step; thus, I was not able to complete this step.
